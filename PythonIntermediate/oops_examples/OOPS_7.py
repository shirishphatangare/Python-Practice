# There are three types of methods in Python:
# instance methods, static methods, and class methods.
#1. Instance Methods: The most common method type. Able to access data and properties unique
# to each instance.
#2. Static Methods: Cannot access anything else in the class. Totally self-contained code.
#3. Class Methods: Can access limited methods in the class. Can modify class specific details.

#static method is bound to a class rather than the objects for that class
#This means that a static method can be called without an object for that class.
# This also means that static methods cannot modify the state of an object as they are not bound to it.

# use-case. When we need some functionality not w.r.t an Object but w.r.t the complete class,
# we make a method static. This is pretty much advantageous when we need to create Utility methods as
# they arenâ€™t tied to an object lifecycle usually.

#2 Approaches to deal with statis methods:1. staticmethod() and 2.@staticmethod
