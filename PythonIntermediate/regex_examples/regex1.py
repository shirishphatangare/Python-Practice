1. Compiling Regular Expressions
- Regular expressions are compiled into Pattern objects, which have methods for various
operations such as searching for pattern matches or performing string substitutions.
Syntax:  re.compile(pattern, flags=0)
- Compile a regular expression pattern, returning a pattern object.
- The regular expression is passed to re.compile() as a string.
- Regular expressions are handled as strings because regular expressions arenâ€™t
part of the core Python language, and no special syntax was created for expressing them.
- Regular expression patterns are compiled into a series of bytecodes which are
then executed by a matching engine written in C.

"""
import re

pattern = re.compile("hello")
print(pattern)

#to ignore letter case in the regex pattern.
pattern = re.compile("hello", flags=re.I)
print(pattern)

#If you are using the same regular expression multiple times, it is recommended to compile it for improved performance.
"""
Pattern objects have several methods and attributes.
- match():Determine if the RE matches at the beginning of the string.
- search():Scan through a string, looking for any location where this RE matches.
- findall():Find all substrings where the RE matches, and returns them as a list.
- finditer():Find all substrings where the RE matches, and returns them as an iterator.
