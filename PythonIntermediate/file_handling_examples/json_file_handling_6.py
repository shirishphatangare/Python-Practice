#Example: Skip nonbasic types while writing JSON into a file using skipkeys parameter
#If Python dictionary contains a custom Python object as one of the keys and if we try to convert it into a JSON format, you will get a TypeError
# i.e., Object of type "Your Class" is not JSON serializable.

#If this custom object isnâ€™t required in JSON data, you can skip it using a skipkeys=true
# argument of the json.dump() method.
#If skipkeys=true is True, then dict keys that are not of a basic type
# (str, int, float, bool, None) will be skipped instead of raising a TypeError
