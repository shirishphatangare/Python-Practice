"""
Take the following python dictionary:

ages = {
"Peter": 10,
"Isabel": 11,
"Anna": 9,
"Thomas": 10,
"Bob": 10,
"Joseph": 11,
"Maria": 12,
"Gabriel": 10,
}

1. How many students are in the dictionary? Search for the "len" function.
2. Implement a function that receives the "ages" dictionary as parameter and return
the average age of the students. Traverse all items on the dictionary using the
"items" method as above.
3. Implement a function that receives the "ages" dictionary as parameter and returns
the name of the oldest student.
4. Implement a function that receives the "ages" dictionary and a number "n" and
returns a new dict where each student is n years older. For instance, new_ages(ages,10) returns a copy of "ages" where each student is 10 years older.
