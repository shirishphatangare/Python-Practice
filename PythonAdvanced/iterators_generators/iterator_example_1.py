#Python Iterators: Iterators are objects that can be iterated upon.
#- They are implemented within for loops, comprehensions, generators etc.
#- It is simply an object that can be iterated upon.
# An object which will return data, one element at a time.
#- Python iterator object must implement two special methods, __iter__() and __next__(),
# collectively called the iterator protocol.
#- object is called iterable if we can get an iterator from it.
# Most of built-in containers in Python like: list, tuple, string etc. are iterables.

#Example: Iterating Through an Iterator in Python
#-next() function to manually iterate through all the items of an iterator.
#- If there is no more data to be returned, it will raise StopIteration
# define a list
my_list = [1,2,3,4]
# get an iterator using iter()
#The Iteration Protocol:The built-in function iter takes an iterable object and returns an iterator.
x=my_list.__iter__()
print("Type of x:",type(x))
my_iter = iter(my_list)
print("Type of Object:",type(my_iter))
## iterate through it using next()
print(next(my_iter))
print(next(my_iter))
## next(obj) is same as obj.__next__()
print(my_iter.__next__())
print(my_iter.__next__())
## This will raise error, no items left (StopIterationError)
#next(my_iter)

#We could do that using the for loop too
#internally, the for loop creates an iterator object, iter_obj by calling iter() on the iterable.

# iter_obj = iter(incoming_iterable)
# while True:
#     try:
#         print(next(iter_obj))
#         #print(iter_obj.__next__()) # This is another way of using next
#     except StopIteration:
#         print("Reached end of iterator")
#         break

- Building Your Own Iterator in Python
- to implement the methods __iter__() and __next__().
 __iter__() : returns the iterator object itself. If required, some initialization can be  performed.
__next__() :must return the next item in the sequence. On reaching the end, and in subsequent calls, it must raise StopIteration.

Iterators have several advantages:
1)Cleaner code
2)Iterators can work with infinite sequences
3)Iterators save resources:when working with iterators, we can get the next element

Lets explore some concepts in Python:
- a container
- an iterable
- an iterator
- a generator
- a generator expression
- a {list, set, dict} comprehension

Containers
- Containers are data structures holding elements, and that support membership tests.
- They are data structures that live in memory, and typically hold all their values in memory,
- E.g of Containers: list, deque,set, frozensets,dict, defaultdict, OrderedDict,tuple, namedtuple, â€¦
- Containers are easy to grasp, because you can think of them as real life containers:
  a box, a cubboard, a house, a ship, etc.
- an object is a container when it can be asked whether it contains a certain element.

Iterables
- most containers are also iterable. But many more things are iterable as well.
- Examples are open files, open sockets, etc. Where containers are typically finite,
an iterable may just as well represent an infinite source of data.
- An iterable is any object, not necessarily a data structure, that can return an iterator
 (with the purpose of returning all of its elements). It has __iter__() method to return an iterator

Iterators
- It's a stateful helper object that will produce the next value when you call next() on it.
- Any object that has a __next__() method is therefore an iterator. How it produces a value
is irrelevant.
- So an iterator is a value factory. Each time you ask it for "the next" value, it knows
 how to compute it because it holds internal state.
- There are countless examples of iterators. All of the itertools functions return iterators.
 Some produce infinite sequences:
 - Itertools(Functions creating Iterators):https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html

Generators
- A generator is a special kind of iterator
